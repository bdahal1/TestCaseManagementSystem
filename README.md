# TestCaseManagementSystem

This is just a begining for Testcase management that I plan to do using QA automation resource at Deerhold. With this My aim is to make my teammates who works as a QA automation engineer to use their free time to learn and work on spring boot applicaiton.
This is spring boot project.
1. Clone this repo
2. Install Mysql
3. Set username root and password root if you dont feel comfortable with other username and password.
4. If other uname and password is used then update with same in application.properties file.
5. Open mysql and create a database tcms
6. Run the project. After successful running, all the tables will be created by spring boot applicaiton in mysql.
7. Inside Dump folder there is a file. Open in Workbench and then run it only after you confirm that tables are created. 
8. In User table there are 2 users. Uname: bdahal and Pass: bdahal for QA manager role and Uname: rkhatri and pass: rkhatri for QA Engineer role. 
9. Open postman and start using apis. Look for base url in application.properties and Controller files for endpoints.
Swagger comming soon
